The project proposes an efficient implementation for IoT (Internet of Things) used for monitoring and controlling the home
appliances via World Wide Web. Home automation system uses the portable devices like smartphone, laptop, etc. as a user interface.
They can communicate with home automation network through an Internet gateway, by means of low power communication
protocols like ZigBee, Wi-Fi etc. This project aims at controlling home appliances via mobile app using Wi-Fi as communication
protocol and node MCU as server system.
NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. The user here will move directly with the system through a web-based interface over
the web, whereas home appliances like lights, fan, etc. are remotely controlled through easy interface provided by a
website/application. The server will be interfaced with relay hardware circuits that control the appliances running at home. The
server communicates with the corresponding relays
The system is installed on a mobile or other networked device, and the user can create time schedules for certain changes to take
effect. Smart home appliances come with self-learning skills so they can learn the homeownerâ€™s schedules and make adjustments
as needed. Smart homes enabled with lighting control allow homeowners to reduce electricity use and benefit from energy-related
cost savings.
